# 🕵️‍♂️ Crime Data Analysis & Visualization (India) 🇮🇳

This project explores, visualizes, and analyzes crime data across Indian districts and states using a cleaned dataset of crime statistics. It includes insightful charts, maps, and interactive dashboards — with a focused lens on trends, comparisons, and crimes against marginalized communities (SC/ST).

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source File:** `clean_crime_district (1).xls`
- **Contains:**
  - Crime statistics by **district**, **state**, and **year**
  - Multiple crime types: Murder, Assault on Women, Kidnapping, Robbery, etc.
  - Legal categories: **POA Act**, **PCR Act**
  - Total crimes per state, per year
